        <div class="mainArticles__section-photo mainArticles__section-photo--manhattan"></div>
        <article class="mainArticles__section-article">
          The Manhattan is a classic cocktail of choice for whiskey-lovers. This
          delightful mix of rye or bourbon whiskey, sweet vermouth, and bitters
          has been adored for hundreds of years because of its subtle bitterness
          and herbal undertones. Seasoned drinkers are able to pick up on the
          hint of sweetness from sweet vermouth and the caramel-like aroma of
          bourbon (if it is used). Rye whiskey, however, is the more traditional
          ingredient and it imparts its distinct spice and savoury taste to this
          well-loved classic cocktail. Whichever is used in the mix, this
          cocktail is great for anyone looking for a balanced multidimensional
          taste with that very little hint of sweetness. All-in-all the
          Manhattan is considered a strong cocktail with regards to its alcohol
          content as well as its undying appeal to bar-goers. Even now, with so
          many new signature drinks stepping into the scene, no respectable bar
          can ever go without this classic cocktail. In this article, we’ll dig
          a bit deeper into the history of the Manhattan cocktail. After all,
          nostalgia is, in essence, pleasantly bittersweet - just like the taste
          of a delicious Manhattan cocktail.As with many classic cocktails, the
          exact origin story of the Manhattan cocktail is lost in time. The most
          popular theory is that the recipe was invented by Dr. Iain Marshall in
          the early 1880’s for a party by Lady Randolph Churchill, the mother of
          Winston Churchill. The supposed explanation behind the name of the
          drink is because this party was held in the Manhattan Club in New
          York. Later on, this theory was pronounced as a myth because, during
          that time, Lady Randolph Churchill was pregnant and was in England -
          definitely not partying in New York. The 1923 book entitled
          “Valentine’s Manual of New York” presented a more plausible story when
          it stated that a bartender at New York’s Hoffman House by the name of
          William F. Mulhall recounted, during the 1880s, that the Manhattan
          cocktail was invented by a man named Black who kept a place ten doors
          below Houston Street on Broadway. Unfortunately, the origins of the
          Manhattan cocktail remain inconclusive. However, some say that the
          dash of mystery about its origins even adds to its appeal.

        <h2 class="mainArticles__section-h2">Perkz going to NA</h2>
        <div class="mainArticles__section-photo mainArticles__section-photo--perkz"></div>
        <article class="mainArticles__section-article">
          Perkz has been one of the pillars of the European League of Legends in
          recent history. Being one of the superstars of the region, he has
          multiple domestic titles with Semifinals and Finals appearances under
          his belt. He was the player who brought G2 Esports on the map in
          League of Legends. However, the question is why does he want to leave.
          We answer all of that and more in this article to paint a picture of
          what we can expect with this reported rumor.To understand the
          magnitude and ramification of such a move is best explained with the
          context in history between both Perkz and G2 Esports. Perkz joined G2
          Esports (then known as Gamers2) in 2015 in the EU Challenger Series
          where they managed to secure a spot in the EULCS (now LEC) in 2016.
          With Perkz in the mid lane, they won four domestic titles and multiple
          appearances at MSI and Worlds. 2018 was their most successful year
          with Perkz at the helm with a deep run into Worlds. In 2019, the
          landscape changed with the signing of another superstar EU midlaner in
          Caps while Perkz moves to ADC. That propelled G2 to win two more
          domestic titles, an MSI win, and a berth to the Worlds 2019 Finals.
          However, that ended in despair with them losing 3-0 to Fun-Plus
          Phoenix. In 2020, to change things up they swapped Caps and Perkz in
          their respective lanes for the Spring split. That netted them another
          domestic title but with a few hiccups in the playoffs. They eventually
          swapped back for the Summer split which got them first place again and
          the first seed at Worlds. They had a strong showing at Worlds
          especially Perkz and Mikyx. However, they lost badly to the eventual
          Champions DAMWON Gaming in the semifinals. Perkz was the player who
          put G2 Esports on the map from a berth to the EULCS and then at the
          Worlds stage before Caps joined in. He was labelled as their franchise
          player for years until the disappointing loss at Worlds 2020 which
          will possibly change the landscape for both parties.

          JavaScript ("JS" for short) is a full-fledged dynamic programming
          language that can add interactivity to a website. It was invented by
          Brendan Eich (co-founder of the Mozilla project, the Mozilla
          Foundation, and the Mozilla Corporation). JavaScript is versatile and
          beginner-friendly. With more experience, you'll be able to create
          games, animated 2D and 3D graphics, comprehensive database-driven
          apps, and much more! JavaScript itself is relatively compact, yet very
          flexible. Developers have written a variety of tools on top of the
          core JavaScript language, unlocking a vast amount of functionality
          with minimum effort. These include: Browser Application Programming
          Interfaces (APIs) built into web browsers, providing functionality
          such as dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles; collecting
          and manipulating a video stream from a user's webcam, or generating 3D
          graphics and audio samples. Third-party APIs that allow developers to
          incorporate functionality in sites from other content providers, such
          as Twitter or Facebook. Third-party frameworks and libraries that you
          can apply to HTML to accelerate the work of building sites and
          applications. It's outside the scope of this article—as a light
          introduction to JavaScript—to present the details of how the core
          JavaScript language is different from the tools listed above. You can
          learn more in MDN's JavaScript learning area, as well as in other
          parts of MDN. The section below introduces some aspects of the core
          language, and offers an opportunity to play with a few browser API
          features too.
